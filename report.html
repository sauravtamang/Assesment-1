        <p>This is my experiences of learning web development, coding and debugging process and the positives and challenges I encountered while learning HTML and CSS.</p>
        <h2>My experiences during this Module</h2>
        <p>This portfolio reflects my learning journey throughout the web development module. It has been an exciting and beneficial journey and during this time, I gained skills in HTML, CSS and responsive design. I also learned a lot about grid layouts and CSS animations, which allowed me to make my website both organized and visually appealing. Overall, this project has been an incredible learning journey, helping me to improve my technical skills and creativity.</p>
        <h2>Design decisions</h2>
        <p>The design of this website is actually based on minimalism and visually appealing. I picked fonts and colors that match my style and represents me. I decided to go with coding background image and light blue fonts which would make it look attractive.</p>
